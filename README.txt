Quick And Dirty Scrambler (qdscram) is a small utility for scrambling files.
To see how to use it, run it without arguments.

No special compilation options are required. Simply compile the appropriate
file and run the result.

Currently, only a version for POSIX-compliant OSes has been made.
It has been tested for:
-Linux 5.18 running on x86_64 with the GNU C Library
-Linux 5.15 running on x86_64 with the Musl C Library
-Android 12 as implemented by Samsung
-OpenBSD 7.1

It has not been tested for WSL, but it should work.

TO-DO:
-Make a Windows version
-Make a DOS version
